@: Usage
#: Time/Space complexity

* String
  - Immutable
  - StringBuilder and StringBuffer is mutable object. StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not, which makes StringBuilder faster and recommended whenever possible.

* Hash Table

* Array

* List JAVA
  - Allow null
  - fail fast for both LinkedList and ArrayList, Vector

* LinkedList JAVA
  # Insert/Delete O(1), find nth O(n)
  - Doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces.
  - null allowed, not synchronized
  - List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...)); // synchronized

* ArrayList JAVA
  # Insert/Delete O(n), find nth O(1)
  # The add operation runs in amortized constant time, that is, adding n elements requires O(n) time.
  - Resizable-array implementation of the List interface. Default is 10.

* Vector Java
  - Synchronized. Recommend ArrayList than Vector in thread-safe env.

* Stack
  # push, pop, top take O(1) time
  @ reverse e.g. parenthesis matching

  JAVA
  - Stack: empty, peek, pop, push, search
  - Implemented by Vector
  - Prefer to use Dequeue(LinkedList or ArrayDeque)

* Queue
  - A collection for holding elements prior to processing.
  - it has head and tail,
  - Null not allowed for all Queue related class and interface
  @ waiting line, buffer for I/O, keyboard stroke.

  JAVA
  - Interface Queue: add, poll ...
  - Interface BlockingQueue: a Queue that add wait for non-emptyp to retrieve and for space to add. Thread safe.
  - LinkedBlockingQueue is unbounded and has higher throughput.
  - ArrayBlockingQueue is bounded and has to give capacity. Less throughput but less variablility in performance.
  - Interface Dequeue("double ended queue"). Can be used as queue or stack. Implementation includes ArrayDeque and LinkedList

* Priority Queue
  - Entries consist of key and value. Order is defined on keys. null not allowed.
  - Implemented by Binary Heap.
  # Min O(1), Insert O(lgn), RemoveMin O(lgn), Construct O(n)
  @ Used as "event queue", key is the time event take place, value is description.

  JAVA
  - PriorityQueue (implements Queue: add, poll, peek...)
  - not synchronized, use PriorityBlockingQueue for synchronization
